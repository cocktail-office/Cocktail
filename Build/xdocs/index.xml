			<p>Project WONDER is a collection of frameworks and tools 
			for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/">WebObjects</a> 
			application server.  It aims to fill some of the gaps left in the 
			packaged product, as well as add some useful and powerful utilities 
			for WebObjects developers.

			example applications:</p>

				<dd>Provides a rich set of tools and additions for use in WebObjects 
				and EOF development.</dd>

				<dd>Provides many extensions and enhancements to WebObjects' 
				DirectToWeb functionality.</dd>
			</dl>
